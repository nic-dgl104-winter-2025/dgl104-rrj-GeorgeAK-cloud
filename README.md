## What I Learned This Week

### Functional Requirements and User Stories
This week, I explored the concepts of functional requirements and user stories in software development. Key takeaways include:

- **User Stories**: These are written in natural language to describe user interactions with a system. They are great for team communication but often lack technical details.
- **Technical Design Documents (TDD)**: Used to address technical concerns and provide a high-level design context. They help align the team on architecture and technologies early in the development process.
- **Functional Requirements**: These describe software features on an input-output basis, similar to programming functions. They provide clear specifications for app features and are often derived from user stories.

Understanding these concepts helps in balancing user experience with technical implementation, ensuring robust and user-friendly applications.

## Research on Haskell

### Overview
Haskell is a purely functional programming language known for its strong static typing and lazy evaluation. It emphasizes immutability and mathematical precision, making it a favorite among those who appreciate clean and reliable code.

### Applications
1. **Academic Research**: Used for teaching functional programming concepts.
2. **Financial Systems**: Employed by companies like Standard Chartered for reliable financial software.
3. **Web Development**: Frameworks like Yesod and Servant leverage Haskell's strengths for building web services.
4. **Data Analysis**: Suitable for handling large datasets and complex computations.
5. **Compiler Development**: Ideal for developing compilers and interpreters due to its support for abstract syntax trees.

### Users
- Academic Researchers
- Financial Software Developers
- Web Developers
- Data Analysts
- Compiler Engineers

### Useful Resources
1. **Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!**: A fun and approachable online book for beginners.
2. **Haskell.org**: The official site with comprehensive documentation and tutorials.
3. **Hackage**: A central package archive for discovering and sharing Haskell libraries.
4. **Stack Overflow**: A platform for solving specific problems and learning best practices in the Haskell community.

## User Stories

**User Story 1: Purchasing a Bus Ticket**

As a commuter, I want to buy a bus ticket online to secure my seat without visiting the station.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Select departure/arrival locations, date, and time.
2. View available bus services.
3. Choose a bus and pay online (credit card, PayPal, etc.).
4. Receive a confirmation email with ticket details.
5. Download or print the ticket from the email or app.

**User Story 2: Checking Bus Schedule**

As a passenger, I want to check bus schedules to plan my trip.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Enter departure/arrival locations without logging in.
2. View schedules for today and tomorrow, including times and prices.
3. Filter results by time, price, or provider.

**User Story 3: Managing Bookings**

As a user, I want to view, cancel, or modify my bookings easily.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Log in to view current and past bookings.
2. Cancel or modify bookings (change date/time/seat).
3. See available options for modifications.
4. Receive confirmation and refund details for cancellations.
5. Get a new confirmation email for modifications.
6. Be informed of any extra charges or refunds.


#### CHOOSE A LANGUAGE FOR COMMUNITY CODE:

For my community coding project, My group  decided to focus on PHP for both the front end and back end. My experience with PHP is limited, but I'm eager to learn more about it. We chose PHP because it's a versatile language that powers many websites and applications, making it ideal for developing dynamic and interactive web pages. PHP is widely used for server-side scripting, and its integration with databases like MySQL makes it perfect for building robust web applications. Additionally, PHP has a large and supportive community, which is beneficial for beginners seeking guidance and resources. [Learn more about PHP](https://www.php.net/manual/en/intro-whatis.php)
