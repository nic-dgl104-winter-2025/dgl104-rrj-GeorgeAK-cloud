## What I Learned This Week

### Functional Requirements and User Stories
### User Stories
This week, I focused on understanding functional requirements and user stories in software development. I wanted to ensure that my explanations were clear and practical, so I included examples and inline code to make the concepts easier to grasp. Writing about these topics helped me reinforce my knowledge and see how they apply in real-world scenarios.

## Functional Requirements and User Stories

- **User Stories**: User stories describe user interactions with a system in simple, non-technical language. They improve communication among team members but often lack technical details (Sommerville, 2015). I wrote about user stories to highlight their importance in software development and how they make it easier for teams to understand user needs.
- **Technical Design Documents (TDD)**: provides technical details about system architecture and technologies. It ensures team alignment early in development (Fowler, 2018).

#### Example of a TDD Concept in Code (Python Flask API Example):
```python
from flask import Flask, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/course/<course_id>')
def get_course(course_id):
    return jsonify({"course_id": course_id, "title": "Software Engineering"})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```
This API structure aligns with TDD principles, where a clear function defines how course data is retrieved (Fowler, 2018).

### Functional Requirements
Functional requirements describe what the software should do, specifying inputs and expected outputs (Sommerville, 2015). This part of my write-up helped me think critically about how to define requirements clearly so developers understand what needs to be built.

#### Example of Functional Requirements:
1. The system must allow users to register with an email and password.
2. The system must allow users to reset their passwords via email.
3. The system must display error messages if login credentials are incorrect.

## Research on Haskell

### Overview
## Research on Haskell
Haskell is a purely functional programming language that uses lazy evaluation and strong static typing. It is widely used in academia and industries like finance, data analysis, and compiler development (Haskell.org, 2025). I enjoyed learning about Haskell because its functional programming approach is different from the imperative languages I’m used to.

#### Haskell Example - Fibonacci Sequence:
```haskell
fib :: Int -> Int
fib 0 = 0
fib 1 = 1
fib n = fib (n-1) + fib (n-2)
```
This example demonstrates recursion, a fundamental concept in functional programming (Haskell.org, 2025).

### Users of Haskell Language
- Academic Researchers
- Financial Software Developers
- Web Developers
- Data Analysts
- Compiler Engineers

### Useful Resources
1. **Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!**: A fun and approachable online book for beginners.
2. **Haskell.org**: The official site with comprehensive documentation and tutorials.
3. **Hackage**: A central package archive for discovering and sharing Haskell libraries.
4. **Stack Overflow**: A platform for solving specific problems and learning best practices in the Haskell community.

#### CHOOSE A LANGUAGE FOR COMMUNITY CODE:

For my community coding project, My group  decided to focus on PHP for both the front end and back end. My experience with PHP is limited, but I'm eager to learn more about it. We chose PHP because it's a versatile language that powers many websites and applications, making it ideal for developing dynamic and interactive web pages. PHP is widely used for server-side scripting, and its integration with databases like MySQL makes it perfect for building robust web applications. Additionally, PHP has a large and supportive community, which is beneficial for beginners seeking guidance and resources. [Learn more about PHP](https://www.php.net/manual/en/intro-whatis.php)

## Week 9
### Summary of Design Patterns

**Overview:**
This week, the class explored design patterns and how they help in software development. I also learned about contributing to open-source projects, which opened my eyes to different ways to be involved in the development community. Writing about these topics helped me connect theory with real-world applications, and I included examples to clarify each concept.

 **Understanding Design Patterns**
Design patterns provide reusable solutions to common programming problems. They were formalized by the "Gang of Four" and help improve code organization and maintainability (Refactoring Guru, 2024). While writing about this, I realized that patterns are not strict rules but guidelines that help developers structure their applications better.

### Key Principles
1. **Program to an Interface, Not an Implementation** – This principle encourages defining behaviors without tying them to specific implementations. It helps improve flexibility in coding (Refactoring Guru, 2024).
2. **Favor Object Composition Over Class Inheritance** – Instead of relying on deep inheritance trees, it's often better to compose objects from smaller components, making code easier to manage and modify.


**Categories of Design Patterns:**
Design patterns are typically classified into three main categories based on their purpose:
1. **Creational Patterns:** These patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, aiming to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. An example is the Singleton pattern, which ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
##### Example - Singleton Pattern (Python)

```python
class Singleton:
    _instance = None
    
    def __new__(cls):
        if cls._instance is None:
            cls._instance = super(Singleton, cls).__new__(cls)
        return cls._instance

singleton1 = Singleton()
singleton2 = Singleton()

print(singleton1 is singleton2)  # Output: True
```
This ensures that only one instance of the class is created.

##### Example - Factory Pattern (JavaScript)
```javascript
class Car {
    constructor(model, year) {
        this.model = model;
        this.year = year;
    }
}

function carFactory(model, year) {
    return new Car(model, year);
}

const car1 = carFactory("Toyota", 2023);
console.log(car1.model);  // Output: Toyota
```
This pattern helps encapsulate object creation logic.
   
2. **Structural Patterns:**  These patterns focus on how objects and classes are composed to form larger structures. They help ensure that if one part of a system changes, the entire system doesn't need to change.
##### Example - Adapter Pattern (Python)
```python
class EuropeanPlug:
    def plug_in(self):
        return "Powering device with European plug."

class USPlug:
    def connect(self):
        return "Powering device with US plug."

class PlugAdapter:
    def __init__(self, plug):
        self.plug = plug
    
    def plug_in(self):
        return self.plug.connect()

us_plug = USPlug()
adapted_plug = PlugAdapter(us_plug)
print(adapted_plug.plug_in())  # Output: Powering device with US plug.
```
The adapter pattern allows incompatible interfaces to work together.

3. **Behavioral Patterns:** These patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects. These patterns focus on communication between objects.

##### Example - Observer Pattern (JavaScript)
```javascript
class Subject {
    constructor() {
        this.observers = [];
    }

    addObserver(observer) {
        this.observers.push(observer);
    }

    notifyObservers(message) {
        this.observers.forEach(observer => observer.update(message));
    }
}

class Observer {
    update(message) {
        console.log(`Received update: ${message}`);
    }
}

const subject = new Subject();
const observer1 = new Observer();
const observer2 = new Observer();

subject.addObserver(observer1);
subject.addObserver(observer2);
subject.notifyObservers("New event occurred!");
```
This pattern is useful in event-driven programming, where multiple objects need to react to state changes.

**Examples of Design Patterns:**
- **Singleton Pattern:** This creational pattern restricts a class to a single instance and provides a global access point to that instance. It is useful for managing shared resources, such as database connections.
  
- **Observer Pattern:** This behavioral pattern allows a subject to notify multiple observers about state changes, facilitating a one-to-many dependency. This is particularly useful in user interface design, where changes in one part of the system need to be reflected in others.


**Conclusion:**
While design patterns provide valuable solutions to common programming challenges, they are not one-size-fits-all solutions. Developers should be aware of the context in which they apply these patterns and consider the potential for over-engineering or creating complex dependencies. Understanding both design patterns and their anti-patterns can lead to better software design practices.


### What I Learned
Before this week, I thought open-source contributions required advanced coding skills. However, I found that anyone can contribute by improving documentation, managing issues, and even assisting with design or translation (GitHub Docs, 2024). This realization was exciting because it meant I could be part of meaningful projects, even as a beginner.

### Steps to Contribute
1. **Find a Project** – I used platforms like "Up For Grabs" and "Good First Issue" to look for beginner-friendly projects (Up For Grabs, 2024; Good First Issue, 2024).
2. **Fork and Clone** – I practiced forking repositories and cloning them to my local machine.
3. **Make a Contribution** – I found a project that needed better range validation in a guessing game and wrote a small fix.
4. **Submit a Pull Request** – I followed the project’s contribution guidelines and submitted my changes for review(GitHub Docs, 2024).

### Example - Fixing Input Validation in JavaScript
I improved the input validation logic in a number guessing game.
```javascript
function validateInput(number) {
    if (number < 1 || number > 100) {
        return "Please enter a number between 1 and 100.";
    }
    return "Valid input!";
}
console.log(validateInput(150));  // Output: "Please enter a number between 1 and 100."
```
This simple fix made the game more user-friendly.

## Reflection
This week, I gained confidence in both software design principles and open-source collaboration. Design patterns helped me understand how to structure applications, while contributing to open-source projects showed me that I could be part of a global community. Searching for the right project to contribute to was a bit challenging. I explored platforms like Good First Issue, Up for Grabs, and CodeTriage to find suitable opportunities. I had specific criteria in mind, and it took considerable time to identify a project that met my expectations.I plan to keep exploring different patterns and contributing more to projects that align with my interests.

#### Finding a Project to Contribute To

One project that caught my attention was the Guess Game created by Prateek Kalra, which can be found [here](https://github.com/prateekkalra/guess-game). I focused on setting appropriate ranges for different difficulty levels and ensuring that players received clear messages if they entered numbers outside those ranges. By tackling these challenges, I helped enhance the game's functionality and overall player experience.

# **Week 10**  
## **Learning MV* Architectural Patterns**  

This week, I explored **MV* (Model-View) architectural patterns**, which are widely used in UI development. These patterns structure applications by separating data, user interface, and logic, making them more maintainable and scalable (Django Project, 2025; Android Developers, 2025). Here’s how I wrote about them, with examples and references.  



## **Key Concepts of MV* Patterns**  

The MVfamily includes several architectural patterns that all share the **Model (M)** and **View (V)** components but differ in their third part. The most commonly used ones are:    

- **MVC (Model-View-Controller)**  
 MVC is one of the oldest and most well-known UI architectural patterns and is a long-standing and widely adopted pattern. . It separates concerns into three distinct parts:  

1. **Model** – Manages application data and business logic.  
2. **View** – Displays data to the user but does not modify it.  
3. **Controller** – Acts as an intermediary, processing user input and updating the **Model** accordingly.  

✅ **Example: Simple MVC Implementation in Python Flask**  

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template

app = Flask(__name__)

# Model
class Task:
    def __init__(self, title):
        self.title = title

# View (HTML Template)
@app.route('/')
def index():
    task = Task("Complete MVC tutorial")
    return render_template('index.html', task=task)

# Controller
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

In this example, the **Model** (`Task` class) holds data, the **View** (`index.html`) displays it, and the **Controller** (`index()` function) handles interactions.  

---

## **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) and Its Importance**  

MVVM is an evolution of MVC and is often used in modern mobile and web development (Android Developers, 2025). It helps separate concerns even further:  

1. **Model** – Represents the application data and logic.  
2. **View** – Displays information to the user.  
3. **ViewModel** – Acts as an intermediary, preparing data for the View while keeping the Model unaware of UI logic.  

**Example: MVVM in JavaScript (Vue.js)**  

```javascript
const app = Vue.createApp({
  data() {
    return {
      task: "Complete MVVM tutorial"
    };
  }
});

app.mount("#app");
```

Here, the ViewModel (Vue instance) manages data binding between the Model and View (HTML).  

 ## MVP (Model-View-Presenter) 

MVP is a variation of MVC, where the Presenter takes full responsibility for UI logic instead of the Controller. It is commonly used in Android development (Android Developers, 2025).  

 **Example: MVP in Java (Android)**  

```java
// Model
public class User {
    private String name;

    public User(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }
}

// Presenter
public class UserPresenter {
    private UserView view;

    public UserPresenter(UserView view) {
        this.view = view;
    }

    public void showUser() {
        User user = new User("Alice");
        view.displayUser(user.getName());
    }
}

// View Interface
public interface UserView {
    void displayUser(String name);
}
```

In this **MVP** example, the **Presenter** (`UserPresenter`) handles logic, ensuring the **View** (`UserView`) only displays data.  

---

## **MVI (Model-View-Intent) and Unidirectional Data Flow**  

MVI is a relatively newer pattern that enforces unidirectional data flow to make applications more predictable. It is particularly useful in state management frameworks (JetBrains, 2025).  

**Example: MVI in Kotlin (Android Jetpack Compose)**  

```kotlin
data class UIState(val counter: Int)

sealed class UIIntent {
    object Increment : UIIntent()
    object Decrement : UIIntent()
}

fun reducer(state: UIState, intent: UIIntent): UIState {
    return when (intent) {
        is UIIntent.Increment -> state.copy(counter = state.counter + 1)
        is UIIntent.Decrement -> state.copy(counter = state.counter - 1)
    }
}
```

This **MVI** example ensures data flows in a single direction, making debugging easier.  

---  


## **Evolution of MVC in Different Platforms**
Different platforms have adapted **MVC** in unique ways:    

- **iOS Development**: Initially relied heavily on MVC, but with the introduction of SwiftUI, it has shifted toward MVVM.  
- **Android Development**: Originally used MVC and MVP, but now prefers MVVM and Jetpack Compose.  
- **Web Development**: **MVC** remains prevalent in frameworks such as Django, Ruby on Rails, Angular, and Vue.  

## **Separation of Concerns and Why It Matters**  

A key takeaway from learning MV patterns is the importance of separating data, user interface, and logic. This improves:  

- **Testability** – Independent modules are easier to test.  
- **Scalability** – Reduces complexity as applications grow.  
- **Maintainability** – Makes debugging and future updates easier.  


## **Applying MVC to Software Development**  

This week, I learned that MVC remains a foundational UI architecture. While newer trends like MVVM are growing in popularity, MVC still plays a critical role in modern applications (Django Project, 2025; Swift.org, 2025).  

### **How I Applied My Learning:**  
 1. Examined how MVC structures function in different programming environments. 
 2. Analyzed real-world implementations in web frameworks like Django and Ruby on Rails.
 3. Researched how MVVM builds upon MVC in mobile app development.**  

---

## **Reflection**  

As I wrote this section, I found MVC easy to understand since it is widely used, but MVI was more complex because of its strict data flow rules. MVVM felt like the most balanced approach, and I can see why it is becoming a popular choice for modern applications.  

Adding code examples for each pattern helped me grasp their differences. While writing, I made sure to keep explanations clear so that someone new to architectural patterns can follow along easily.

### **  Week 11: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts and Application**  

During  this week, I explored Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) extensively with special focus on key OOP principles and SOLID design principles and how they are used in practice. Below is a systematic outline of what I learned with examples, what it was like to apply OOP on a team programming assignment, and what I learned about our choice of programming language.


## **Understanding Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**  

OOP is a programming paradigm that organizes code into objects, making it modular, reusable, and scalable. This approach is widely used in modern software development due to its efficiency and maintainability (TechTarget, 2024).  

OOP consists of four fundamental principles which are :  

### **1. Encapsulation**  
Encapsulation restricts direct access to an object’s data and allows controlled access through methods. This ensures data protection and prevents unintended modifications.  

 **Example of Encapsulation in Java:**  

```java
class BankAccount {
    private double balance; // Private variable (not directly accessible)

    public BankAccount(double balance) {
        this.balance = balance;
    }

    public double getBalance() { // Controlled access via getter
        return balance;
    }

    public void deposit(double amount) { // Controlled modification
        if (amount > 0) {
            balance += amount;
        }
    }
}
```

This example shows that balance is private, and can only be changed through controlled methods like **deposit()** (Wikipedia, 2024).

---

### **2. Abstraction**  
Abstraction hides the implementation details and only exposes necessary functionalities.  

 **Example of Abstraction in Java:**  

```java
abstract class Animal {
    abstract void makeSound(); // Abstract method (must be implemented by subclasses)

    void sleep() {
        System.out.println("Sleeping...");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Woof! Woof!");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal myDog = new Dog();
        myDog.makeSound();  // Outputs: Woof! Woof!
    }
}
```
This ensures developers can interact with a class without needing to understand its full complexity (Stack Overflow, 2024).  

---

### **3. Inheritance**  
Inheritance allows a class to reuse properties and methods from another class, enabling code reusability and hierarchical relationships between objects.  

 **Example of Inheritance in Java:**  

```java
class Vehicle {
    String brand = "Toyota";

    void honk() {
        System.out.println("Beep! Beep!");
    }
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
    String model = "Camry";
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car myCar = new Car();
        myCar.honk(); // Outputs: Beep! Beep!
        System.out.println("Car brand: " + myCar.brand + ", Model: " + myCar.model);
    }
}
```
With inheritance, the Car class doesn't need to re-write the honk() method — it inherits it from Vehicle (Eluminous Technologies, 2023)  


### **4. Polymorphism**  
Polymorphism allows a **single method to be used in different ways** depending on the object.  

  **Example of Polymorphism in Java:**  

```java
class Animal {
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Some generic animal sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Woof! Woof!");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal myAnimal = new Dog();
        myAnimal.makeSound();  // Outputs: Woof! Woof!
    }
}
```
This makes programs more flexible and scalable (Gee CS Oswego, 2024).  

---

## **SOLID Principles and OOP Best Practices**  

To enhance code maintainability and flexibility, we also learned about the SOLID design principles  

### **1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**  
> A class should have only **one** reason to change.  
🔹 **Example:** Instead of having a single `User` class handle both authentication and database storage, we should split these responsibilities into separate classes.  
Each class should only have one job. This helps keep code focused and easy to debug.

“There should never be more than one reason for a class to change.”
(Clean Coder, 2014a)

🔗 Reference: [The Single Responsibility Principle - Clean Coder](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2014/05/08/SingleReponsibilityPrinciple.html)  

---

### **2. Open-Closed Principle (OCP)**  
> Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.  

🔹 **Example:** Instead of modifying existing classes, we should use inheritance or interfaces to extend their functionality.  

🔗 Reference: [The Open-Closed Principle - Clean Coder](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2014/05/12/TheOpenClosedPrinciple.html)  

---

### **3. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**  
> Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.  

 **Example:** Instead of a large interface handling multiple responsibilities, break it into smaller, specific interfaces.  

🔗 Reference: [Interface Segregation Principle - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_segregation_principle#:~:text=In%20the%20field%20of%20software,are%20of%20interest%20to%20them.)  

---

## **Applying OOP to Our Group Programming Assignment**  

### **How OOP Will Be Used in Our Project**  
For our group programming assignment, we will apply OOP principles to ensure our project would be modular, maintainable, and reusable**.  

**Example: Implementing OOP for a User Management System**  
- `User` (Base class): Stores user details.  
- `AdminUser` (Child class): Extends `User` with additional permissions.  
- `GuestUser` (Child class): Extends `User` with limited access.  
- `AuthenticationManager or Leader` (Encapsulation): Manages user login without exposing sensitive data.  

By structuring our code this way, we separate responsibilities and reduce complexity, making future modifications easier.  

---

## **Is Our Chosen Programming Language OOP-Capable?**  

### **Chosen Language: Python**  
Python is fully OOP-capable, supporting encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.  

 **Does Python support other paradigms?**  
Yes! Besides OOP, Python also supports:  
- **Procedural Programming** (using functions without objects)  
- **Functional Programming** (using lambda functions and higher-order functions like `map()`, `reduce()`, and `filter()`)  

 **Why is Python a good choice?**  
- It allows **multiple paradigms** (OOP, procedural, and functional).  
- It has **easy-to-use syntax**, making it beginner-friendly.  
- It has **strong community support** for best practices.  

  **Example of Python’s OOP Support:**  

```python
class User:
    def __init__(self, name, email):
        self.name = name
        self.email = email

    def display_info(self):
        print(f"User: {self.name}, Email: {self.email}")

class AdminUser(User):
    def __init__(self, name, email, admin_level):
        super().__init__(name, email)
        self.admin_level = admin_level

admin = AdminUser("Alice", "alice@example.com", "SuperAdmin")
admin.display_info()
```

## **Final Thoughts**  
OOP is a powerful paradigm that makes code structured, reusable, and scalable. Using OOP principles and SOLID design in our group project ensures that our code is easy to maintain, extend, and debug. Python’s full OOP support, combined with its ability to support multiple paradigms, makes it an ideal language for our project.

Sure! Here's the updated **Week 12 Journal README** with a **reliable and accurate replacement** for the first reference (Ford). I’ve substituted it with a well-cited academic-style blog article from **IBM Developer** that discusses why functional programming matters:

# **Week 12 – Functional Programming**

## **What I Learned This Week**

This week, we were taught Functional Programming and how it fits within the Declarative Programming Paradigm. At first, it felt abstract, especially coming from an object-oriented background. However, the examples and real-life use cases helped me grasp why functional programming is valuable—especially in modern development environments.

I learned that functional programming is all about writing predictable, clean, and testable codes using functions that don’t alter program state. Functional programming treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data (Wazner, 2023). What stood out to me most was the idea of pure functions, higher-order functions, and recursion.


 **Key Concepts of Functional Programming**

  **Imperative vs Declarative**
- Imperative programming focuses on how to perform tasks (step-by-step), using loops and control flows.
- Declarative programming focuses on what the result should be, hiding the control flow under the hood (Kumar, 2022).

 **Pure Functions**
Pure functions always return the same result for the same inputs and don’t cause side effects.

```javascript
// Pure Function
function square(x) {
  return x * x;
}
```

Unlike functions that modify external variables or states, this function’s output depends solely on its input.


 **Higher-Order Functions**
A function that can accept another function as an argument or return one.

```javascript
function calculate(x, y, operation) {
  return operation(x, y);
}

const add = (a, b) => a + b;
console.log(calculate(2, 3, add)); // Output: 5
```

Higher-order functions are essential in libraries like React, Vue, and Lodash (MDN, 2024).

###  **Recursion**
Functional programming prefers recursion over loops. A function calls itself until a base case is met.

```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n-1)

print(factorial(5))  # Output: 120
```

This recursive function avoids mutation and aligns with FP principles (Thompson, 2021).

## **Working with Collections**

Functional languages often work with collections (like arrays, lists) using built-in methods like `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`.

###  Filter Example
```kotlin
val numbers = listOf(-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3)
val positives = numbers.filter { it > 0 }
println(positives) // Output: [1, 2, 3]
```

###  Map Example
```kotlin
val result = numbers.map { it * 2 }
println(result) // Output: [-4, -2, 0, 2, 4, 6]
```

These methods are shorter, easier to read, and don’t alter the original data structures, supporting the immutability principle.

---

## **Side Effects and State Changes**

One of the most important benefits I learned is that funcctional programming helps avoid side effects. In traditional OOP code, modifying shared states can lead to bugs. Functional programming avoids this by treating data as immutable and state changes as isolated computations (Paul, 2020).



## **Real-World Usage of Functional Programming**

Programming languages like Haskell and Elm are purely functional, but most modern languages like JavaScript, Python, Swift, and Kotlin support FP features. These languages are multi-paradigm, which means we can mix functional programming with OOP styles depending on the use case (Wikipedia, 2024).

### Kotlin Collection Example

```kotlin
val evenNumbers = (1..10).filter { it % 2 == 0 }
println(evenNumbers) // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

This method is functional and declarative and reduces the chance of bugs.

## **Reflection**

I found functional programming challenging a bit in the beginning, especially since I’m more familiar with object-oriented logic. But learning about pure functions, higher-order functions, and recursion helped me see how functional programming enables a clean, testable, and reliable code.

I wouldn't mind using more functional programming tools in projects. I can now understand that even though we use object-oriented languages such as Kotlin or Swift, we can still write functional-style codes that are more maintainable and less error-prone.
